## aletheia: _Programming_â€”not promptingâ€”Foundation Models

**Documentation:** [aletheia Docs](https://aletheia.ai/)

----

aletheia is the framework for _programmingâ€”rather than promptingâ€”language models_. It allows you to iterate fast on **building modular AI systems** and offers algorithms for **optimizing their prompts and weights**, whether you're building simple classifiers, sophisticated RAG pipelines, or Agent loops.

aletheia stands for Declarative Self-improving Python. Instead of brittle prompts, you write compositional _Python code_ and use aletheia to **teach your LM to deliver high-quality outputs**. Learn more via our [official documentation site](https://aletheia.ai/) or meet the community, seek help, or start contributing via this GitHub repo and our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XCGy2WDCQB).
